# Spam message detection
In this project, we have implemented basic natural language processing in python. In the underlying project we have developed a spam detection filter with the help of NLTK library to segregate the difference between a ham and a spam. Ham in our project refers to an e-mail or message which is considered to be a good mail. Spam refers to an e-mail or message which is inappropriate and irrelevant, while is usually sent out in bulk to large number of recipients. The data has been analysed for the segregation of hams and spams using labels, determining the frequency using a sparse matrix, training and testing the dataset, and determining the accuracy of various classification algorithms to determine which has the maximum accuracy in this case. We have worked with NLTK library and stopwords package to work on this project.
